<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Diamonds for Jewelry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD</li><li>HPHT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synthetic diamonds for jewelry are primarily produced through two methods: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT). CVD involves creating diamonds in a chamber by depositing carbon gases, resulting in high-quality stones with fewer impurities. In contrast, HPHT mimics natural diamond formation by applying extreme heat and pressure to carbon. Both methods offer lab-grown diamonds that are more affordable and ethically sourced compared to mined diamonds, appealing to environmentally conscious consumers in the jewelry market.</p></p>
