<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Viscometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotational Viscometer</li><li>Capillary Viscometer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The blood viscometer market includes two primary types: rotational viscometers and capillary viscometers. Rotational viscometers measure the resistance of blood flow by rotating a spindle in the sample, providing direct viscosity readings and enabling real-time monitoring. In contrast, capillary viscometers determine viscosity by observing the time taken for blood to flow through a narrow tube under gravity, making them suitable for precise measurements in laboratory settings. Both types serve critical functions in clinical diagnostics and research involving blood properties.</p></p>
